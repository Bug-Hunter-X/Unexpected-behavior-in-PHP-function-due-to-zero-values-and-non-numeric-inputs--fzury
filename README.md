# PHP Function Bug

This repository contains a demonstration of a common PHP function bug involving incorrect handling of zero values and non-numeric inputs.

The `bug.php` file shows the original function with the bug, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The bug lies in the lack of robust input validation and error handling.
